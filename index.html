            Many first-year computer science students at the University of South Carolina struggle to manage their time effectively between coding projects, coursework, and personal commitments, leading to increased stress and declines in academic performance.

        Time management problems among first-year CS students at USC stem from â€” inaccurate time estimation, weak motivation, lack of digital organization tools, limited academic support, and declining well-being.
        These issues reinforce one another, leading to stress, missed deadlines, and lower academic performance.

        The FlowBoard sketches illustrate a mobile app designed to help students organize and manage their academic workload efficiently.
        Sketch 1 shows the Home Dashboard, where users can view their current tasks and daily class schedule at a glance. Each task includes course names, due dates, and progress indicators to help students prioritize their workload.
        Sketch 2 displays the Add Task screen, allowing users to enter key details like task name, due date, course, and estimated time needed for completion. This helps users plan their study sessions more accurately.
        Sketch 3 represents the Focus Timer, a productivity feature that helps users stay on track by timing focused work sessions. It includes options to pause or end a session and clearly displays remaining time. 
        Together, these wireframes demonstrate the core flow of FlowBoard: adding assignments, scheduling time, and maintaining focus through structured task management.
